An app does not have to exist for you to register it.

To register an app:

. Log in to Anypoint Platform.
. Click *MQ* in the left navigation bar or the main Anypoint Platform screen.
. Click *Destinations* in the left navigation pane.
. Click *Client Apps* from the left navigation pane:
. Click the blue plus circle:
