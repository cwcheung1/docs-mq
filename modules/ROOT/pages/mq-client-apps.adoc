in a Mule app in Anypoint Studio.

== Regenerate a Client Secret 

You might need to regenerate the client secret for a client app ID if your organization's security policy requires that you  change client secrets on a schedule.
You might want to revoke access to a client ID by a specific consumer or publisher.
In these cases, you can regenerate the client secret in Anypoint MQ and reconfigure the secret in those apps for which you want to allow access.

To regenerate the client secret:

. Log in to Anypoint Platform.
. Click *MQ* in the left navigation bar or the main Anypoint Platform screen.
. Click *Client Apps* from the left navigation pane.
