A _queue_ is a temporary storage area for a message. You can create queues, FIFO queues, and dead-letter queues in Anypoint Platform. You can also send and receive messages from a queue in Anypoint Studio.

Using Anypoint MQ, you can create two types of queues: 

* Standard queue
+
These queues don't guarantee a specific message order. Standard queues are the best fit for applications in which messages must be delivered quickly.
+
Anypoint MQ supports up to 120,000 in-flight messages per standard queue.

* FIFO (first in, first out) queue
+
These queues ensure that your messages arrive in order. FIFO queues are the best fit for applications requiring strict message ordering and exactly-once delivery, but in which message delivery speed is of less importance. See <<FIFO Queues>>.
+
Anypoint MQ supports 10 in-flight messages per message group in a FIFO queue.

You can assign either standard or FIFO queue type as a dead-letter queue (DLQ). See <<Dead Letter Queues>>.

Standard queues can be bound to a xref:mq-exchanges.adoc[_message exchange_], enabling you to send messages to multiple queues.

You can filter queues by type in the Destinations page:

== Prerequisites

You must create an environment, user access, and roles for accessing Anypoint MQ before configuring queues. See xref:mq-access-management.adoc[Configure Environment, User, and Role Access].


== Create a Queue

To create a standard queue or FIFO queue:

. Log in to Anypoint Platform.
. Click *MQ* in the left navigation bar or the main Anypoint Platform screen.
. Click *Destinations*.
. Click the blue plus-circle icon to display the menu:
+
image::mq-blue-create.png[]
+
. Select *Queue* or *FIFO Queue*.
+
For *Exchange*, see xref:mq-exchanges.adoc[Configure Message Exchanges].
. Complete the fields in *Create Queue* or *Create FIFO Queue*:
+
image::mq-create-queues.png[]
+
** *ID* specifies the queue name.
+
Queue names can contain up to 127 alphanumeric characters (a-z, A-Z, 0-9), periods (.), and hyphens (-). They cannot contain spaces or other characters. 
+
** *Message TTL* (Time to live) specifies how long unprocessed messages persist before being deleted. 
+
The maximum TTL for a message is two weeks.
** *Message Lock Default TTL* specifies how long a message waits before being put back into the queue in the event of  server failure when the message is not acknowledged.
+
The lock makes the message unavailable to other apps while locked, but does not block other messages from being read.
+
The maximum Lock TTL is 12 hours.
** *Assign Default Delivery Delay* specifies how long to delay delivery for messages sent to the queue.
+
You can specify to delay message delivery in seconds, minutes, hours, or days. When you send a message, you can override the default delivery delay. See xref:mq-understanding.adoc#delay_queues[Delay queues].
** *Encryption* (optional) encrypts all messages in the queue. See xref:mq-understanding.adoc#encrypt-queue[Encrypted queues].
** *Assign a Dead Letter Queue* (optional) assigns the DLQ.
+
The DLQ is a previously created queue to which to send undeliverable messages. See <<Dead Letter Queues>>.
. Click *Create Queue*.
+ 
The queue is created and appears in the Destinations page:
+
image::mq-queue-details.png[]
+
From this page, you can: 

* Click the queue type for the new queue to display its details in the right pane.
* Click the queue ID or details label to display the Queue Settings page. 

== Send a Message to a Queue

Message content can be text, JSON, or CSV (comma-separated values). The maximum size of a message is 10 MB. 

To send a text message to a queue:

. In *Anypoint Platform > MQ*, click *Destinations* in the left pane.
. Click the queue ID to display the Queue Settings page:
+
image::mq-queue-settings.png[]
+
. In the settings page, click *Message Sender* in the left pane.
+
** *Type* is *Text*, *CSV*, or *JSON*.
+
See also 
xref:mq-queues.adoc#send-a-json-message-to-a-queue[Send a JSON Message to a Queue] and 
xref:mq-queues.adoc#send-a-csv-message-to-a-queue[Send a CSV Message to a Queue].
+
** *Payload* contains the message payload text, such as `Hello Mules!`.
** *Delivery Delay* (standard queue only) indicates the time to delay the message delivery (optional). 
+
If you specified *Assign Default Delivery Delay* on the standard queue, you see the default delivery delay. You can override that value for this message or set a delivery delay for a message in a queue without delivery delay. 
+
Delayed delivery is not supported for individual messages in a FIFO queue.
+
See xref:mq-understanding.adoc#delay_messages[Delayed delivery for messages].
+
** *Message Group ID* (FIFO queue only) specifies the message group to which the message belongs.
+
Message group IDs can contain up to 128 alphanumeric characters and punctuation (!"#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\]^_`{|}~). They cannot contain spaces.
+
To preserve message order for an app, you might want to create a message group for each application to send messages.
+
image::mq-fifo-msg-groups.png[]
+
See <<FIFO Queues and Message Groups,FIFO queues and message groups>>.
. Click *Send*.

== View the Number of Messages in a Queue

You can verify that a message arrived in the queue by viewing the number of messages in the queue from the Destinations page.

To see the number the messages in the queue:

. In *Anypoint Platform > MQ*, click *Destinations* in the left pane.
. Click the queue type for the queue to display its details in the right pane.
+
The detail pane shows the number of messages in the queue:
+
image::mq-msgs-in-queue2.png[]

== Get a Message from a Queue

You can verify that a message arrived by retrieving it from the queue.

To get a message from a queue:

. In *Anypoint Platform > MQ*, click *Destinations* in the left pane.
. Click the queue ID to display the Queue Settings page:
+
image::mq-queue-settings.png[]
+
. In the settings page, click *Message Browser* in the left pane.
. If you are retrieving messages from a FIFO queue, click the checkbox to acknowledge 
that viewing messages through the browser might cause other consumers of the queue to be blocked from accessing messages in the queue:
+
image::mqfifo-message-browser.png[]
+
. Click *Get Messages*.
. Click the message row to view the message payload in the right pane:
+
image::mq-click-id2.png[]

If you want to return the message to the queue (for example, if other applications want to read the message), click the *Return Messages* icon:

image::mq-click-retmsgs2.png[]

If you return to the Message Sender or Destinations page, messages automatically return to the queue.

Returning the messages to the queue is a not-acknowledgment operation (NACK). The message is not altered. However,
the time to live (TTL) value you set when you created the queue determines how long the message is available before Anypoint MQ deletes it.

Alternatively, you can delete the message by clicking the trash can icon in the details pane:

image::mq-message-delete-trash-can-icon2.png[]

Deleting a message is an acknowledgment operation (ACK). For information about how Anypoint MQ processes ACK messages, see xref:mq-ack-mode.adoc[Acknowledge Messages].

== Send a JSON Message to a Queue

To send a JSON message to a queue:

. In *Anypoint Platform > MQ*, click *Destinations* in the left pane.
. Click the queue ID to display the Queue Settings page:
+
image::mq-queue-settings.png[]
+
. In the settings page, click *Message Sender* in the left pane.
. Set the *Type* to *JSON*.
. In the *Payload* field, enter this text:
+
[source,json,linenums]

. Set the *Type* to *CSV*.
. In the *Payload* field, enter this text:
+
----
"dog",
"fish",
"parrot"
----
+
For *Delivery Delay* (standard queue only) and *Message Group ID* (FIFO queue only), see <<Send a Message to a Queue>>.
. Click *Send*.
. Click *Message Browser*, and then click *Get Messages*.
. Click the message row to view the message payload in the right pane:
+
image::mq-csv-get-msg2.png[]


== Purge Messages from a Queue

To purge all the messages in the queue:

. In *Anypoint Platform > MQ*, click *Destinations* in the left pane.
. Click the queue type for the queue to display its details in the right pane.
. Click the *Purge Messages* icon in the details pane:

image::mqfifo-purge-msgs-icon.png[]

In the Purge Messages page, click the checkbox, and then *Delete Messages* to verify that you want to purge all messages in the queue:

image::mqfifo-purge-messages.png[]

== Delete a Queue

If a queue is no longer needed, you can delete it. Any in-flight messages in the deleted queue are lost. You can't recover a deleted queue.

To delete a queue:

. In *Anypoint Platform > MQ*, click *Destinations* in the left pane.
. Click the queue type for the queue to display its details in the right pane.
. Click the trash can icon in the upper right:
+
image::mq-delete-queue-icon.png[]
+
. In the Delete Queue page, click the checkbox to verify that you want to delete the queue, and then click *Delete Queue*:
+
image::mq-delete-queue.png[]
+
The time it takes to delete or purge a queue is approximately one minute. During this time, the status of the affected queue can't be updated.

== FIFO Queues

For applications where the order of messages must be strictly preserved and enforced, Anypoint MQ provides first in, first out (FIFO) processing to enable message ordering. With FIFO queues, Anypoint MQ ensures that the order in which messages are placed in a queue is the same order messages are retrieved.

FIFO queues have the following benefits and restrictions:

* Are limited to 300 TPS (transactions per second) 
+
However, if you batch 10 messages per each read and write operation (maximum) using the API, FIFO queues can support up to 3,000 TPS.
* Support delivery delay on all messages in the FIFO queue
+
If you change the delivery delay for a FIFO queue, the setting change is retroactive to all messages in the queue. Delayed delivery is not supported for individual messages in a FIFO queue. 
* Provide  encryption
+
Encrypting a FIFO queue does not affect the order or the contents of messages consumed.
* Can be used as a DLQ
+
When assigning a DLQ to a FIFO queue, the DLQ must also be a FIFO queue.
* Cannot be bound to a message exchange
* Should not be used with `prefetch` mode.

To create a FIFO queue, see <<Create a Queue>>. To determine if a queue is FIFO or standard (non-FIFO), view its details. 

See the xref:mq-faq#regions[Anypoint MQ FAQ] for the regions in which Anypoint MQ and FIFO queues are available.

For information about creating FIFO queues with the Admin API, see xref:mq-apis.adoc#create-a-fifo-queue-in-the-admin-api-portal[Create a FIFO Queue in the Admin API Portal].

=== FIFO Queues and Message Groups

Message groups enable multiple consumers to access messages in a FIFO queue. Only one consumer can access messages in a message group at a time. Message order is preserved within the message group. When a consumer is accessing a message group, other message groups in the FIFO queue are available to other consumers, reducing the chance that the FIFO queue is blocked.

You use the message group ID to specify the message group that the message belongs to. 

The FIFO queue processes messages in the message group one by one, in the order they were added.  Message order is not enforced across message groups.

If multiple applications send messages associated with the same message group ID to a FIFO queue, the messages are stored in the order they arrive. To preserve message order for an app, make sure that each app uses a specific message group ID to send messages.

If a message doesn't have an associated message group ID, the message is assigned to a default message group. If you require a single group of ordered messages, provide the same message group ID for messages sent to the FIFO queue.

=== FIFO Exactly-Once Delivery

For applications in which messages must be processed exactly once, such as those used in transactional use cases, FIFO queues ensure exactly-once message delivery.

FIFO queues provide message deduplication. If multiple messages are sent to a FIFO queue containing the same message ID, the first message to arrive is kept as the valid message. Subsequent messages within the deduplication interval of five minutes are considered duplicates and are discarded. For example, after the queue sees that a message with ID `12345` arrives in the queue, for the next five minutes, the FIFO queue discards any messages with the ID `12345`.

When building applications in Anypoint Studio that require exactly-once delivery, you can either:

* Set the message ID in the publisher settings in the Anypoint MQ connector.
* Let Anypoint MQ autogenerate a unique message ID for each message sent to a queue (default).

== Dead Letter Queues

Anypoint MQ enables you to ensure that messages that aren't delivered are sent to a queue known as the dead-letter queue (DLQ). You can then analyze the messages sent to the DLQ to determine why those messages were not delivered. 

A DLQ is essentially the same as any other queue except that it receives only undelivered messages. You can specify the time to live (TTL) value, encryption, and delivery delay when you create the queue. 

You must have at least two queues for one of them to be assigned as a DLQ. Both queues must be:

* The same type (standard or FIFO)
* In the same geographical xref:mq-faq.adoc#regions[region]
* In the same environment and owned by the same Anypoint Platform account.

=== Encryption

Undeliverable messages that are sent to the DLQ use the encryption set for the source queue, regardless of the DLQ encryption setting. Messages that are sent directly to the DLQ by a client use the encryption setting for the DLQ. If your organization's policy is that all messages are encrypted, then you must set encryption for all queues.

=== Billing and Maximum Deliveries

If a message sent to the DLQ is a dead letter from another queue, the message is not charged against the billable message units. However, if a client sends a message directly to a DLQ, that message is charged.

If a queue has a dead-letter queue assigned:

* Viewing the messages in the source queue using the Anypoint MQ *Message Browser* counts against the number of maximum deliveries.
* Viewing a message and returning it to the queue counts as a NACK operation and is considered an unsuccessful delivery attempt.
* Deleting the message in the *Message Browser* prevents it from being counted against the maximum deliveries, but the message is lost.

=== How Messages Are Sent to a DLQ

This flowchart shows how messages are sent to a DLQ:

image::mq-dlq-flowchart.png[]

=== Assign a DLQ to a Queue

You can assign any queue as a DLQ for another queue as long as it's the same type and in the same region and environment. 

* Messages sent to a FIFO DLQ must originate from a FIFO queue. 
* Messages sent to a standard DLQ must originate from a standard queue.
+ 
See <<fifoqueues,FIFO Queues>>.

To assign a DLQ to a queue:

. <<Create a Queue,Create a queue>>. 
. Toggle *Assign a Dead Letter Queue* to *On*.
+
The following additional fields appear:

image::mq-create-q-dlq.png[]

* *Dead Letter Queue Name* 
+
Choose a previously created queue name from the drop-down list.
* *Reroute after 10 attempts* (Optional)
+
Specify how many times Anypoint MQ attempts to deliver messages in the queue before rerouting the message to the dead-letter queue. If not specified, the default value is 10 tries. This value ranges from 1 to 1000 attempts.

=== Recover Messages from a DLQ

You can recover messages from the DLQ using the REST API to get the message from the queue and writing the message to a new queue. See xref:mq-apis.adoc#mqadminapi[Anypoint MQ Admin API].

=== Determine Whether a Queue is a DLQ

You can see whether a queue is a DLQ by viewing its details:

image::mq-queue-view-dlq.png[]

You can also view details of each queue from the REST Administration API, using the Get Queue REST endpoint. 

[source,json,linenums]
----
{
 "encrypted": false,
 "type": "queue",
 "queueId": "my-dlq-1",
 "deadLetterSources": [
   "my-queue-4",
   "my-dls-1"
 ],
 "defaultTtl": 2000000,
 "defaultLockTtl": 2000000
}
----

If DLQ is set, the returned entities contain the `deadLetterSources` field. 

For more information, see xref:mq-apis.adoc#mqadminapi[Anypoint MQ Admin API].
