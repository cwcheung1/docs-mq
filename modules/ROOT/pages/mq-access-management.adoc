Anypoint Platform enables you to manage the roles of users who administer the Anypoint MQ features in Anypoint Platform for your organization.

== Create an Environment

Before you give yourself Anypoint MQ access permissions, create an environment with which to associate permissions.

. From Anypoint Platform, select *Access Management*
. Click *Environments* in the left menu, and click the *Add environment* button.
. In the *Add environment* box, provide a name for your environment and click either *Production*, *Sandbox*, or *Design*. 
You might want to create separate environments for each. In this case, choose *Production*.


== Give Users Anypoint MQ Access Permissions

First, give yourself Anypoint MQ access permissions and then give others in your organization access.

Assign user permissions to yourself for use with Anypoint MQ. These permissions enable you to create client applications and destinations by creating queues and exchanges. You can use the same information to assign user permissions for others in your organization.

To assign user permissions:

. From Anypoint Platform, click *Access Management*.
. Click *Users* in the left menu.
. Click a user name.
. Click *MQ* and set an environment and permissions:

. Click the drop-down list and select an item from the menu.
+
For permissions, you can click *Select all* to set all permissions, or *Select none* to erase previously clicked settings.
. Click the blue plus icon (+) to add the selection.
+
The selected environment and permissions appear below the drop-down list.
+
You can delete items from this list by clicking the delete icon.

== Create an Admin Role

You can create a role that you can apply to other users in your organization.
While you don't need roles to complete the tutorial, when you use Anypoint MQ as an administrator or developer, you should create roles for users in your organization who use Anypoint MQ.

Creating a role enables you to assign access rights to users in your organization, such as administrators, developers, or users (who only view information but don't change it).

. From Anypoint Platform, click *Access Management*.
. Click *Roles* in the left menu, and then click the *Add Role* button.
. Name the role `Admin Role` and click the *Add role* button.
. Click *Admin Role* and click the *MQ* tab.
. From the *Environment* menu, select *Production*.
. From the *Permissions* menu, select *Select all*.
. Click the blue plus icon (+) to add the selections.
+
Anypoint Platform displays your settings.

The settings are:

* *Clear destinations*
+
Same privileges as *View destinations*, plus permission to purge messages
* *Manage clients*
+
Same privileges as *View clients*, plus permission to create client apps
* *Manage destinations*:
+

** Create new queues and message exchanges
** Edit existing queues and message exchange settings
** Access *Message Sender* and *Browser* pages

View all client apps and the client App IDs and client secrets for each client app
* *View destinations*:
+
View all destinations and each destination's settings (*ID*, *Type*, *Message TTL*,and *Message Lock Default TTL*). View *In Queue* messages and *In Flight* messages.
